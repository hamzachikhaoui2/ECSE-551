Machine Learning for Engineers

**Overview**
Electrical Engineering : Introduction to machine learning: challenges and fundamental concepts. Supervised learning: Regression and Classification. Unsupervised learning. Curse of dimensionality: dimension reduction and feature selection. Error estimation and empirical validation. Emphasis on good methods and practices for deployment of real systems.

**Overview of Assignemnts**:
- Assignment 1 : Implementation of a Logistic Regression Classifier from scratch. Implementation of the following accuracy improvement techniques : learning rate schedule, L1 and L2 regularization methods, nested K folds cross validation.
- Assignemnt 2 : Implementation of a multi-class Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch for textual data samples. This assignment was a great way to study verctorizing a textual data set, iterating over different train-test splits, the impact of removing stop-words from a textual sample dataset, implementation of TF-IDF, Stemming, Lemmatization, Normalization, and the effects of removing punctuation from the textual sample dataset.
- Assignment 3 : Implementation of multiple neural networks for a 10 class classification model. Implementation of some custom Neural Networks architecture, and some pre-existing architectures such as Spinal VGG, VGG16, VGG19, and VGG5.
